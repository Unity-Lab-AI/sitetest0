## Project Vision & Goals

**Overview:**
This project is a comprehensive AI-powered website showcasing the Pollinations API through a landing page, demo environment, and full-featured chat application.

**Key Components:**

1. **Landing Page (index.html)** - ~90% complete
   - Professional showcase of UnityAILab
   - Navigation to Demo and AI pages
   - Clean links to in-repo projects only (no external project links)
   - Responsive design across all devices
   - External links ONLY for libraries, services, and platforms

2. **AI Landing Page (/ai)** - ~95% complete
   - Professional landing page introducing Unity AI Chat
   - Links to demo and describes full AI experience
   - SEO optimization with meta tags and social cards
   - Responsive design across all devices
   - Links to demo for early access

3. **Demo Page (/ai/demo)** - ~85% complete (IMPLEMENTED!)
   - Interactive demo showcasing Pollinations API functionality
   - Text-to-Text chat with multiple AI models
   - Text-to-Image generation with advanced controls
   - TTS (Text-to-Speech) with 6 voice options
   - Model selector, parameter controls, chat history
   - Markdown rendering with syntax highlighting
   - Responsive design with mobile support
   - CORS-compatible, browser-compatible implementation
   - Needs: Additional features, polish, testing

4. **Main AI Chat App** - Not in this repo (External)
   - Full-featured chat app planned for future (like ChatGPT, Gemini, DeepSeek)
   - Would include: sessions, folders, agents, memory
   - Custom features: live voice chat, page control, system connector
   - Professional layout with sidebar navigation
   - Currently external deployment

**Architecture:**
- **PolliLibPy**: Python reference implementation (direct from Pollinations docs)
- **PolliLibJS**: JavaScript browser-based version (mirrors Python functionality)
- **Development Flow**: Python files as reference, JavaScript for serverless browser execution

**Standards:**
- **Responsiveness**: Seamless experience from extra small to extra large screens
- **Cross-Browser**: Works across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge with proper fallbacks
- **Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliance, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
- **Performance**: Optimized loading, minimal layout shifts, responsive images

**Link Policy:**
- In-repo projects: Link freely (pages in this repo)
- External projects: Do NOT link to other projects (like unity.unityailab.com, CodeWringer)
- External services: OK to link (libraries, platforms, Discord, GitHub org, npm packages, CDNs)

**Current Priorities:**
1. Update landing page navigation (add Demo and AI links)
2. Clean up external project links on landing page
3. Plan and structure /demo page
4. Plan and structure /ai page
5. Establish and implement responsiveness standards
6. Ensure cross-browser compatibility
